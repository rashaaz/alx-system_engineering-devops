# Web Stack Debugging #0

## Description
This repository contains solutions for the Web Stack Debugging #0 project as part of the curriculum at Holberton School. The project aims to teach debugging skills in web stack environments.

## Concepts
For this project, understanding of the following concepts is necessary:
- Network basics
- Docker
- Web stack debugging

## Background Context
The Webstack debugging series focuses on training individuals in the art of debugging. Debugging is an essential skill for Full-Stack Software Engineers. This series presents broken or bugged webstacks and tasks participants with creating a Bash script that rectifies the issues, bringing the webstack to a working state.

## Tasks
### Task 0: Give me a page!
- **Description**: Apache needs to run on the container and return a page containing "Hello Holberton" when querying the root of it.
- **Example**: After starting the Docker container, curling the port 8080 mapped to the Docker container port 80 returns an error message. The task requires fixing the issue so that curling port 80 returns a page containing "Hello Holberton".

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error
- Bash scripts must run without error
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script does

## Usage
To solve the task, follow the instructions provided in the task description and execute the necessary Bash commands to fix the issue.
