# 0x07. Networking basics #0

## Project Overview

This project focuses on networking basics, covering concepts such as the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, UDP and TCP protocols, and ports. The project aims to deepen understanding and knowledge of fundamental networking concepts.

## Project Schedule

- **Start Date:** January 3, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** January 5, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** January 5, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** Automatic launch at the deadline

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to explain the following networking concepts without relying on external sources:

1. OSI Model
   - What it is
   - Number of layers
   - Organization

2. LAN (Local Area Network)
   - Typical usage
   - Typical geographical size

3. WAN (Wide Area Network)
   - Typical usage
   - Typical geographical size

4. Internet

5. IP Address
   - Types: Private and public
   - IPv4 and IPv6

6. Localhost

7. TCP and UDP Protocols
   - Mainly used data transfer protocols for IP

8. Differences between TCP and UDP

9. Ports
   - Memorizing SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers

10. Ping/ICMP
   - Purpose and usage

## Tasks

### 0. OSI model

#### Questions

1. What is the OSI model?
   - Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
   - Conceptual model characterizing communication functions without regard to internal structure and technology
   - Model characterizing communication functions with a strong regard for internal structure and technology

2. How is the OSI model organized?
   - Alphabetically
   - From the lowest to the highest level
   - Randomly
