#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This Bash script demonstrates process management and signal handling.
# It creates a PID file '/var/run/myscript.pid' containing the PID of the script.
# The script displays "To infinity and beyond" indefinitely with a sleep of 2 seconds.
# It sets up signal handlers for SIGINT (Ctrl+C), SIGTERM, and SIGQUIT.
# When receiving a SIGINT, it echoes "Y U no love me?!".
# When receiving a SIGTERM, it echoes "I hate the kill command" and terminates itself, cleaning up by removing the PID file.
# A trap is set for SIGQUIT to call the terminator function and handle cleanup.
