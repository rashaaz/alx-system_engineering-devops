# Project: 0x0B. SSH

This project focuses on understanding and working with SSH (Secure Shell) for remote server access and management.

## Background Context

You've been attributed an Ubuntu server hosted in a datacenter. You'll connect to it using SSH with an RSA key, providing secure access to the server.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is a server and where servers usually reside.
- The fundamentals of SSH and its role in secure remote communication.
- How to create an SSH RSA key pair for authentication.
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair.
- The advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`.

## Resources

To complete this project, you can refer to the following resources:

- Text and video resources explaining the concept of physical servers and SSH essentials.
- Tutorials on SSH configuration files, public key authentication, and how SSH works.
- Crash courses and detailed explanations on SSH encryption and connection processes.

## Requirements

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Files end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root is mandatory
- All Bash scripts must be executable
- The first line of all Bash scripts: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all Bash scripts must explain what the script does

## Tasks

You are required to complete the following tasks:

1. **Task 0**: Describe what an SSH RSA key pair is.

2. **Task 1**: Create an RSA key pair.

3. **Task 2**: Provide the SSH configuration file used to connect to a server using an RSA key.

4. **Task 3**: Add the SSH public key to the server for remote access.

5. **Task 4**: Execute a Bash script to display the text `Welcome` on a specific port.

6. **Task 5**: Connect to a server using an SSH RSA key pair and run a command.

## Conclusion

Understanding SSH is crucial for secure remote server management. Through this project, you'll gain practical experience in SSH configuration, key management, and remote access, enhancing your skills as a DevOps and System Administrator professional.
