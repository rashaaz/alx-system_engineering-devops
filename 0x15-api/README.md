# SE Foundations Curriculum

## Overview
This curriculum focuses on foundational concepts in software engineering, with a specific emphasis on API usage, Python scripting, backend development, and understanding API data structures. The curriculum includes hands-on projects aimed at imparting practical knowledge and skills necessary for modern system administrators and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers).

### Project Details
- **Project Name:** 0x15. API
- **Technology Stack:** Python, API, Backend
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Duration:** Mar 25, 2024 6:00 AM - Mar 26, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Mar 25, 2024 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Background Context
Traditionally, system administrators relied heavily on Bash scripting. However, with the evolution of system management practices, modern system administrators, often termed as SREs, are expected to possess a broader skill set, including proficiency in programming languages like Python. APIs play a crucial role in modern software architecture, enabling interaction with applications and datasets. This project aims to familiarize learners with API concepts and Python scripting to handle data effectively.

## Resources
- [Friends donâ€™t let friends program in shell script](resource_link)
- [What is an API](resource_link)
- [What is a REST API](resource_link)
- [What are microservices](resource_link)
- [PEP8 Python style](resource_link)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this curriculum, learners should be able to:

- Explain the limitations of Bash scripting and identify scenarios where Python is more suitable.
- Define API and REST API, understanding their significance in modern software development.
- Recognize the role of microservices in building scalable applications.
- Understand data serialization formats like CSV and JSON.
- Adhere to Python coding conventions for better readability and maintainability.

## Copyright & Plagiarism
- Solutions must be original and meet the specified learning objectives.
- Plagiarism in any form is strictly prohibited and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **First Line:** All files should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Libraries:** Imported libraries must be organized alphabetically
- **README.md:** A mandatory README.md file is required at the project root
- **Code Style:** Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) should be used
- **Executable:** All files must be executable
- **Documentation:** All modules should have documentation
- **Data Access:** Use `get` to access dictionary values
- **Code Execution:** Code should not execute when imported

## Tasks
- **0. Gather data from an API:** Retrieve employee TODO list progress using a REST API.
- **1. Export to CSV:** Extend the script to export data in CSV format.
- **2. Export to JSON:** Extend the script to export data in JSON format.
- **3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries:** Extend the script to export data for all employees in JSON format.
